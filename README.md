# Analyzing-the-Impact-of-Gaming-on-Academic-Performance
📖 Overview
This project examines how gaming habits affect students' academic performance. Using a dataset containing details like playing hours, parental income, and grades, we apply exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and regression modeling to uncover trends.

Key Questions Explored:
✅ Does gaming time negatively impact grades?
✅ Do students with highly educated parents perform better?
✅ Is there a correlation between family income and gaming frequency?

📂 Dataset Information
The dataset includes the following columns:

Feature	Description
Sex	Student's gender (Male / Female)
School Code	Unique identifier for the school
Playing Years	Number of years the student has been gaming
Playing Often	Frequency of gaming (scale 1-5)
Playing Hours	Hours spent gaming per day
Playing Games	Number of game types played (0: No, 1: Yes)
Parent Revenue	Annual family income
Father Education	Father's education level
Mother Education	Mother's education level
Grade	Student's academic grade

📊 Methods & Approach
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Scaling numerical data
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing grade distributions
Analyzing correlations (gaming hours vs. grades, parent income vs. grades)
3️⃣ Regression Modeling:

Applying Linear Regression to predict grades based on gaming habits and demographics
Evaluating model performance
📈 Key Visualizations
🔹 Correlation heatmap to explore relationships between features
🔹 Scatter plots to see trends (e.g., gaming hours vs. grades)
🔹 Box plots for parent income and academic performance

🖥️ How to Run the Project
1️⃣ Install Dependencies
Ensure you have the required libraries:

bash

Edit
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
2️⃣ Run the Jupyter Notebook
bash
Copy
Edit

Open the notebook and execute the cells step by step.

📌 Expected Outcomes
Identify patterns between gaming habits and academic success
Develop a predictive model to estimate grades
Provide insights for parents and educators on the balance between gaming and studies
